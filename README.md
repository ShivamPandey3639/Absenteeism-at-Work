Absenteeism is typically defined as a regular pattern of missing work in any sector without valid reasons, which negatively impacts employee morale, disrupts company timelines, and leads to increased production costs. Traditionally, companies have tried to reduce absenteeism using manual methods, but these approaches have become inefficient as businesses transition to more advanced tracking tools, making it harder to monitor absenteeism effectively. In this project, we will leverage data to identify key factors that influence the likelihood of absenteeism, measured in hours. This analysis will enable organizations to take informed measures for better workforce planning, improved employee engagement, and minimizing the financial consequences of unplanned absences.
